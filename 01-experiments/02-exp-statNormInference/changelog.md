# Change Log [02-exp-statNormInference] -> [02-exp-statNormInference] V2

- removed information about statistical norms from the first instruction screen
- added '(see picture below)' and replaced `black-box-marble-machine.png` with `marble-machine.png`
- added information about statistical norms as further instructions after the first set of comprehension questions
- made information about statistical norms more explicit and added `black-box-possibilites-machine.png`
- changed options in comprehension question about statistical norms
  - from: '90% for blue marbles and 10% for red marbles', '10% for blue marbles and 90% for red marbles'
  - to:  '90% for blue marbles and 10% for red marbles', '90% for red marbles and 10% for blue marbles'
- changed information on the first screen 'everybody knows how it works' -> 'everybody on the island knows how it works'
- changed what information is highlighted in 'Further instructions'
- changed final task question: 'do you think it is more likely that the islander knows that red marbles or blue marbles are more likely to be released?' -> 'do you think that, according to the islander, red marbles are more likely than blue marbles to be released or the other way around?'


We obtained 106 responses to the first version of Experiment 2.
However, when analysing the data, we discovered that only 35.8% of the respondents passed all comprehension questions for a final sample of 38.
Most failed on a comprehension question relating to the statistical norms held by the islanders.
In the second version of the experiment, we therefore changed the wording to be more explicit, as well as separated the information into its own section with the relevant comprehension questions right after it.
